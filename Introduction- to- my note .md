# Introduction to Biology of Cancer: Module Wise Notes

## 1. Introduction to the course:

The course I completed based upon one of the core concepts of my degree in b tech bio engineering was based upon a 3 course package of cancer biology. It is essential for me to understand cancer at an expert level since cancer is one of the most pressing issues of deaths worldwide. The course offered deep insights about various aspects of cancer from the identification to imaging and treatment possibilities. The course is a beginner friendly mode of the platform. Offered by Johns Hopkins University, one of the most prominent universities in the medical field for decades. The course had five instructors, each experts in the various modules that they taught. With the six module course, the aim was for the learners to clearly understand the essentials of cancer research:

1.  To identify various types of cancer.
2.  To verify the various hallmarks of cancer.
3.  To study the contribution of genes in the growth of cancer.
4.  Understand the basics of Metastasis.
5.  To analyze the role of imaging diagnosis and screening in cancer.

My main purpose for opting for this course was to gain further insights about cancer biology, starting with acquiring the very basic and nuanced knowledge of the disease. As a student aiming to work in the field of biomedical research, it is very essential to grasp the basics of the pressing issues of the medical world. Cancer is a very serious problem of the modern day, with rate of patients predicted to reach 20 million annually by 2030, a need to properly understand its dynamics and find cures and bridging the gaps in research is felt. The graveness is felt more when we factor in the current rate of deaths per year by cancer - 8 million! Via this course I tend to start a project of my own to understand the intricacy of different types of cancer. By the help of the 3 part course of Coursera, I aim to do a project that can help in figuring out a method to minimize the graveness of the disease.

By the help of these entries I will break down the information I gained from each module and update my learning so that I can refer to them for my future works.

The following part would be my class notes of each the lectures of each module, I have aligned them according to my understanding and added diagrams wherever necessary. Personal notes or images will be referenced and the flow of the notes might differ from the flow of the lectures of each module.
